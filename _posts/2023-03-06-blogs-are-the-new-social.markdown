## So, whats all this about?
Well, i have entered the tech scene and see so many blogs that I hit on a daily basis with those hidden nuggets of knowledge. 

## So why a blog
As i go about my day, I have a lot of these moments where i find something that I think others may fnd interesting, get them out of a bind.
Theres time when a good rant is all I need, so here we are.
Then I think others might be interested in anothers journey in tech, self concerns etc

## Who am I.
Entered the tech scene!!!. Oh i hear, another halfwit thinking they can jump on the tech bandwaggon.
Well its not quite like that, for many years id had an interest in tech. Lots of playing over the years, hacking websites, playing and hacking games, fixing stuff (breaking stuff), building stuff.
I've played with windows and linux plus anything that I could get into. Ive worked in the manufacturing scene for a long time and linked alot of inopperable schemes together and dropped all the way back to using win3.1 for printing, macros in MSoffice, UNIX, C#, lots of wierd and wonderful tech bits.
So, oppotunity knocked and I decided to go to uni and take a BSc in CompSci and Cyber Sec.

Now, im really in the tech scene. I work for a real tech company.

Thats it. I know past stuff that im trying to fit into my new existance, know new stuff that im seeing if it is useful and the stuff im learning is the new horizon.
Its daunting, exciting and so often I wonder, can I do this... Obviously yeah and id like to share all this with you :D 

So here we are, a new outlet for me to share with anyone who is interested (or no doubt talk to myself).
It will contain, 
- bits of my week
- bits ive learned
- vents about tech and goings on
- feeling 
- wierdness
- more or less, anything kinda tech related (or even not)

as always, the line - These opinions are all my own, they in no way constitute any link to the company I work for

Now the dull bit is over, let me get to work on writing a blog
So, should it be 
- SVB (Silicon Valley Bank)
- LTT - Hes better looking with a beard for one, but is he a tech persons guilty pleasure to watch or a real tech god. Lets be honest, he needs to just get a grip of linux
- How WFH is good or bad
- Back stabbers
- What is a tech role and the wide range
- Women in tech and how to fix it
- Are we sick of hearing about ChatGPT - will it really put us out of work

So many things, so short on time.
Some, dare we cover :/ 

Be nice and make someone smile today
