No-one said this blog was just tech! 

## Well, everybody is depressed arnt they??

Is mental health a bandwagon that has become fashionable? It is a shame that it can be seen this way. Fed up, down in the dumps, a bit sad!! all are moods but they are not depression. 

Looking for a description (not mine) -    
Depression is a serious mental health condition, characterised by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss or lack of interest in activities. 
Depression can be caused by many factors including genetics, life events including chemical imbalances of the brain.

Symptoms include:
- Feeling persistently sad or empty
- Loss of interest
- Sleep disturbances, insomnia or oversleeping
- Fatigue or lack of energy
- Change of appetite
- Change of weight
- Difficulty concentrating, making decisions, memory issues like remembering things
- Feeling worthless, guilty or helplessness
- Thoughts of death or suicide
- A feeling of whats the point

Depression can be treated with a combination of therapy, medication, and lifestyle changes. Therapy, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy or talk therapy, can help individuals identify negative thought patterns and develop coping mechanisms. Medication, such as antidepressants, can help correct chemical imbalances in the brain. Lifestyle changes, such as exercise, healthy eating, and stress reduction, can also be helpful in managing depression.

If you or someone you know is struggling with depression, **it is important to seek help from a healthcare professional**. Depression is a treatable condition, and with the right support and resources, individuals can recover and live fulfilling lives.
     
## A little like a star sign, we can all get it to fit

Those symptoms could fit anyone couldn't they. 
Tired a lot? yeah! could be depression
Feel worthless? Could be depression... 
or they could be in the first case, drinking a lot, over working, bad mattress, second, your partner is a bad person, grief for a recent loss - There are lots of reasons.

## So, Yeah I have depression    
I've heard this so many times.
   - *"I suffer from depression!!!!"*    
   - *"Oh, When were you diagnosed?"*

when I hear
   - *"Oh, I self diagnosed"*

Im like - what, I bet your pardon!!!!

- *"Why you being an arse and so rude?"*    
- *"Its my autism, i cant help it"...*    
Shut up, persons who have autism arnt arseholes!!! youre just being a dick and looking for an excuse.

I've heard this with all the "trendy" terms/issues we have these days 
- Autism
- Gender issues
- Dyslexia
- Asperger
- the list goes on.....

Believe me, I have empathy for genuine cases but everybody seems to be looking for an issue, an excuse for something.   
If you genuinely have any of these issues or concerns, you need to see a professional.

**So**, I have been diagnosed and its not the first time and here I will tell you my story (some parts of my story are redacted for privacy etc, but i hope this will help if you are in a similar situation)

## How did I find out

When I was younger, early 20s, I found out. 

I used to be, as a child, quite withdrawn, quiet. I wont cover it here but my childhood kinda sucked but I was by the age of around 14 kinda happy with me. I'd got to a point where I enjoyed being nice.    
I found I could smile at an old lady on the bus and this would make her smile. This made me happy and being nice made me feel good.

I was still a quiet person and felt my life was pre planned due to social suroundings and it was just to be like all the others around the local area and that was fine.  
I took an apprentice job and it went, in hindsight, as it generally does for a young, non worldly wise, young man - just ok but i was happy.    
I had done a lot of growing between 18 and 20 (felt like a long time then), I gained a lot of confidence. I realised I could take on anything, speak to anyone etc.    
Then it all starts going wrong.

I've always been quite trusting and had taken a job where I made a good friend. We would spend dinners together, laugh a lot, talked about our partners, advised each other and we were to grow in the workplace and life together.  
Promotion came and they turned. I was so hurt. They lied about many things and this got me in trouble at work and demoted. I was so hurt and didn't know how to take this.  
Id lost my outside of work best friend as they had found a partner who took a shine to me and made inappropriate asks of me. I told my friend of these comments and some how i was the bad one?.

It was all going a bit shit, my life was folding in on itself, I left I had no-one to reach out to, felt such a disappointment to my family, I had lost control. 

I met a new person and we connected. This was a bad decision and I knew it. It wasn't the set up I was meant to connect with, it wasnt the plan my mother had but it felt good.    
They were in a shitty space, I was in a shitty space. We could sit and talk for hours about anything. 

I eventually told my mother and this was the start of a whole collapse of my relationship with her, thing were just getting worse. 

I'm missing chunks out like my partners children hating me, being overlooked for promotions but ultimately I went to the doctors to talk about a medical condition and it turned out that I was suffering from what was referred to as a complete mental breakdown (this is not the term you can use now :D)     
They advised me to take a break from everything and take some strong tranquilizers. I told my mother, and she said "Get a grip and don't tell anyone at work" - It would of been career suicide to say this at that time, and so I got a grip, took a two-week holiday, through the pills in the bin and painted on a smile and never spoke of the demons again.

Honestly, I wanted to die. Yeah, weak, running away, cowards way out.... these are many terms used and thoughts people have.    
How easy would it be, no more pain, no more sadness, no more loneliness. 

Why did I stay? Because my partner made me feel special and made me laugh and one of my partners children, a little girl that doted on me. She really loved me, I felt like I was her world, and we giggled a lot... I couldnt do it to her.  

Now I can skip a lot as it was grey. I was never the same person. I had to wrestle each day just to get through, I became a passenger in life with those around me dictating what I did, how, where etc. I had moments of the old me where I would run with a little confidence but it would last days at most. I became unkind to myself and numb to life.  
I was scarred and it was never going away, so many times I thought about dying but that would only help me, only take my ache away - when I love, I love deep and never wanted to hurt others.  

So how do I describe the feeling of depression. 
If you tied a bungee rope to your back and started running. It would be easy at first and then.... it gets tighter and harder. Eventually, boing, you get pulled back into the dark pit (depression).  
That is how my life was but it became a comfortable pain. It became an evil buddy. I felt that I wouldn't be me without it.  

Now, we had a child. If you have children, you will know the feeling of _oh my god, I am the rock this thing leans on **FOREVER**_.    
I started to feel trapped in life, just working to keep my family but, at times had some happiness, but the monster of depression ruins every part of your life.

- You have a kid? - what happens if I die
- You are happy? - that means Im gonna be sad when this period ends
- You do a good job - that means this is the new baseline and so is always expected    
Every positive is a negative and it is exhausting.

So, things fell to shit big time when the company I worked for got sold. I had done well and had _FINALLY_ found a happy place. I was happy at home, I loved my job, loved my teammates and the pay was good. See, every time its good means my life is gonna be shit and go downhill.  
 
I took a chance and I went to Uni... I smashed it out of the park but guess what, imposter syndrome and depression are cruel. 

The pressure was immense but the time was great. I became something like the person I wanted to be but by now, no one needs me.     
Children are grown up, my wife is not interested. This is probably because things in life and I had changed, and without talking you ain't gonna know where people are mentally/emotionally.     
Some of this sounds uncoordinated, but that is the mindset, like a ping pong ball in the mind.
  
So what now. I get a job in a cutting edge tech company and it is very different from my old life and makes a huge personal change. Anyway, these new workspaces are very different from my old space and openess is a thing.    
I found I am really good at advising others and found that I was a good listener. I was speaking to a workmate one day and they were telling me about their depression then out of blue he said `"do you take medication for your depression?"`. **OMG.** I had never spoken of my issues and so was taken aback and that made a crack in the dam.    
Times had changed and it was easier to be open but old habits die hard and I couldnt tell people of my struggles. As far as I was concerned, its embarrassing to be weak emotionally (my perception).  

#### Oops 
One day I was talking to a medical professional on behalf of my son and inquired about mental health therapy that was advertised and I had a brief moment of feeling happy to speak about being fed up with feeling low.    
I immediately regretted it and became embarrassed. I had issues from my childhood, issues from my teens, issues long after, all had been greyed out and hidden away but I also really felt that there was no point in life.    
The medical professional just happened to be a mental health therapist, taking time away from therapy (They take time off as it can be quite taxing to be a therapist), and I was immediately assessed.    
Its kinda lucky as I would of backed out if I had a chance, so being immediately assessed, I couldn't and a week later, I was in front of my therapist. cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) was the chosen therapy.

## What was involved?
  
**Quick version:** 
You dont get treated. You get taught to address thoughts in a different manner and are helped to treat yourself.  
 
**Longer Version:**
CBT, or cognitive-behavioral therapy, is a type of talk therapy that is used to treat a variety of mental health conditions, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD.     
CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are interconnected, and that by changing our thoughts and behaviors, we can change the way we feel.

CBT is typically conducted in a one-on-one session with a licensed therapist. During a CBT session, the therapist and client work together to identify negative thought patterns and behaviors that may be contributing to the client's mental health concerns. The therapist then teaches the client strategies to challenge and reframe negative thoughts, and to replace unhelpful behaviors with more positive ones.

For example, if someone with social anxiety is afraid to attend social events because they believe they will be judged by others, the therapist might use CBT to help them challenge this belief by asking them to think about times when they have attended social events and had positive experiences. The therapist might also teach the client relaxation techniques or social skills to help them feel more confident in social situations.

CBT typically involves weekly sessions for several months, although the length and frequency of therapy can vary depending on the individual's needs. CBT has been shown to be an effective treatment for a variety of mental health conditions, and it can be used in combination with medication or other treatments for optimal results.

So, i am going to pass on some of the tools given to me. Like many things, there are many tools in the therapy box of tricks, what works for you may not work for someone else. Therefore, you may need a butter knife to undo your screw, ill use a chisel, others may need the flathead screwdriver.

A term also used is talking therapy and this is where it starts, Talking.    

NOW, I had always been very cynical of therapy but, you end up speaking to someone that is invested in you and its surprisingly easy to talk.

So why is this different than talking to a pal.    
If you talk to a pal/partner, they care deeply, and they wish to help, they want to fix the issue. Your therapist doesn't, they want to give you the tools to fix it.    

“`
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime."
“`

Workpal Example.  
- **You:** `Bob, How do you do so and so?` 
- **Bob:** `Here are mate, Give it here, I'll do it`     
Problem solved - It is done with care and compassion but you are not any further forward

With CBT, tools are offered to help you and here are a couple that helped me.    

One is chatting and having no direct feedback. The received theme from my point of view was that my emotions were questioned and where needed, challenged or affirmed.    

To give an example, lets try when questioning your job abilities.     
_Chatting:_ I may express the thought that im not good enough to do my role.    
This isn't affirmed, nor is this challenged. This would now create a number of questions of why you feel this way, what qualifies you for the role, how did you get the role, what have you done that is good, what have you seen go wrong, pro's v cons's.

Another tool is the perception report.    
This asks you to record a feeling or emotion, measure your feelings at this time, thoughts or feelings around this and then a number of differing perceptions. Here is what an entry would look like.
- **Feeling :** `My partner didnt say they loved me when I ended our phone call`
- **Emotion and Measure :** `Sad 60%`, `angry 70%`, `questioning 20%`
- **Thoughts or Feelings :** `I always say I love them, is that not important to them?`, `Why dont they care, are my emotions not important to them`, `They have been distant, have they found someone else?`
- **Perceptions :** `This is built around a set of asks :` 
    - What would a person who cared for themself think or say
    - When you are 80, will it matter 
    - What three good things could come from this
    - What would a close friend say.....   
    Your answers could be:  
        - `Will this matter when your 80? Well they say it most times so in the scheme of things, prob not` 
        - `What could come as good? Its a sign that it is no longer just a habit but said when meant`
        - `It will mean more when it is said`

There are a lot of other perceptions and these can be considered with your therapist, this allows you to explore the answers and push the questions more but, it is a helpful thing to do with or without a therapist.     

Is it intrusive? You could fill this in at the time that each thing occurs but ultimately, you could do it twice a day eg dinner and bedtime or even just like a diary and once a day... I hear you say `but I might miss some bits`.     

Well if you dont remember it at nighttime, does it really matter? 
One other benefit is I always seemed to have a busy mind and my sleeping pattern was awful: Writing you day down, plans for tomorrow, worries, allows you to clear your mind and sleep better.     

If you then assess the list yourself once a week, you can see what really matters, you may see that with a change in perspective, actually, all the negativity can be changed to positive.    
Lets take a look    

`Your partner didnt phone on a night out.`    
_Lets go negative :(._     
They are having intimate time with another person, they dont care about me and have forgotten me, They are drunk and vulnerable.     

_Lets now switch :_     
They are having fun and you should be happy for them, They love you so much they dont need to be attached at the hip and will love you more. 

Just this switch can change so many things.
Repetition is the key to challenging the auto response you have to a scenario.

Just visiting a note from earlier regarding my going to uni and my wifes distance or perceived none interest. One thing my therapy taught me was its not all about you :D. Think why, think about others thoughts and how this can effect them and then you.
To place myself in my wifes shoes (she has smaller feet so its difficult :D).
The husband that has for so long been on a linier path, steady, you know whats happening from one week to the next. All this has changed. They have a new set of friends, all young, they are looked upto, they are going out more, they are changing.
How scary must that be for her.


## Final Bit

Only you have control of you. Small changes you make can make huge changes to your life.     

My last bits of advice:
- Therapy will hurt and bring up things you have buried or dont want to cover
- don't make it secret. 

#### Ouch
I dont want to cover all my things but we all have baggage. You will cover this, you will pick up the box, open it, look inside and repackage the goods in a better way. To make an example, imagine if the box is childhood. Your perception would be from a childs POV. Now youre an adult.    
You will have a very different perception now, you can re-assess.

You will be given chance to talk it over, work in through and make peace with the box.    
You will also find better ways to deal with life in general.


#### Inform
Your therapy should not be a secret. Ok, you dont need to be that person that is telling everybody like they have a special badge. No one really cares but let your partner know whats going on. 

Imagine if you nightly walk into the kitchen and ask your partner if they need help making dinner.     
They reply no thanks.     
You respond with slight hurt that you'd like to help but they just advise that they want to do it on their own...     
you sulk away in a huff.    

Now after some therapy, you've realised that this making dinner time is "their" wind down time and letting them unwind is good    
So, now you change and you ensure that they know you'd like to get involved and you love them and they only need to ask and you'll be there.    

If you dont make them aware,---

This isn't affirmed, nor is this challenged. This would now create a number of questions of why you feel this way, what qualifies you for the role, how did you get the role, what have you done that is good, what have you seen go wrong, pro's v cons's.

Another tool is the perception report.    
This asks you to record a feeling or emotion, measure your feelings at this time, thoughts or feelings around this and then a number of differing perceptions. Here is what an entry would look like.
- **Feeling :** `My partner didnt say they loved me when I ended our phone call`
- **Emotion and Measure :** `Sad 60%`, `angry 70%`, `questioning 20%`
- **Thoughts or Feelings :** `I always say I love them, is that not important to them?`, `Why dont they care, are my emotions not important to them`, `They have been distant, have they found someone else?`
- **Perceptions :** `This is built around a set of asks :` 
    - What would a person who cared for themself think or say
    - When you are 80, will it matter 
    - What three good things could come from this
    - What would a close friend say.....   
    Your answers could be:  
        - `Will this matter when your 80? Well they say it most times so in the scheme of things, prob not` 
        - `What could come as good? Its a sign that it is no longer just a habit but said when meant`
        - `It will mean more when it is said`

There are a lot of other perceptions and these can be considered with your therapist, this allows you to explore the answers and push the questions more but, it is a helpful thing to do with or without a therapist.     

Is it intrusive? You could fill this in at the time that each thing occurs but ultimately, you could do it twice a day eg dinner and bedtime or even just like a diary and once a day... I hear you say `but I might miss some bits`.     

Well if you dont remember it at nighttime, does it really matter? 
One other benefit is I always seemed to have a busy mind and my sleeping pattern was awful: Writing you day down, plans for tomorrow, worries, allows you to clear your mind and sleep better.     

If you then assess the list yourself once a week, you can see what really matters, you may see that with a change in perspective, actually, all the negativity can be changed to positive.    
Lets take a look    

`Your partner didnt phone on a night out.`    
_Lets go negative :(._     
They are having intimate time with another person, they dont care about me and have forgotten me, They are drunk and vulnerable.     

_Lets now switch :_     
They are having fun and you should be happy for them, They love you so much they dont need to be attached at the hip and will love you more. 

Just this switch can change so many things.
Repetition is the key to challenging the auto response you have to a scenario.

Just visiting a note from earlier regarding my going to uni and my wifes distance or perceived none interest. One thing my therapy taught me was its not all about you :D. Think why, think about others thoughts and how this can effect them and then you.
To place myself in my wifes shoes (she has smaller feet so its difficult :D).
The husband that has for so long been on a linier path, steady, you know whats happening from one week to the next. All this has changed. They have a new set of friends, all young, they are looked upto, they are going out more, they are changing.
How scary must that be for her.


## Final Bit

Only you have control of you. Small changes you make can make huge changes to your life.     

My last bits of advice:
- Therapy will hurt and bring up things you have buried or dont want to cover
- don't make it secret. 

#### Ouch
I dont want to cover all my things but we all have baggage. You will cover this, you will pick up the box, open it, look inside and repackage the goods in a better way. To make an example, imagine if the box is childhood. Your perception would be from a childs POV. Now youre an adult.    
You will have a very different perception now, you can re-assess.

You will be given chance to talk it over, work in through and make peace with the box.    
You will also find better ways to deal with life in general.


#### Inform
Your therapy should not be a secret. Ok, you dont need to be that person that is telling everybody like they have a special badge. No one really cares but let your partner know whats going on. 

Imagine if you nightly walk into the kitchen and ask your partner if they need help making dinner.     
They reply no thanks.     
You respond with slight hurt that you'd like to help but they just advise that they want to do it on their own...     
you sulk away in a huff.    

Now after some therapy, you've realised that this making dinner time is "their" wind down time and letting them unwind is good    
So, now you change and you ensure that they know you'd like to get involved and you love them and they only need to ask and you'll be there.    

If you dont make them aware, it would be a huge shock to your partner if they didn't know you are taking therapy and some changes may happen.

Like many things, you get out what you put in. 

**Keep safe, look after yourself and remember, if you had a bad back, you would go to the doctor. Well a bad mental state is no different.** it would be a huge shock to your partner if they didn't know you are taking therapy and some changes may happen.
