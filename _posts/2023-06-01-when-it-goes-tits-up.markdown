## So, you've made a BIG mistake?

There are little mistakes made each day that go unnoticed but every now and again a bigger one is made. So what do you do?


Well, if you are that person who sits back and rides the coat tails of others, pops a helpful line into slack and walks away as an incident is in progress, just points out what is only known with hindsight.... Fuck you  
These are those that like to get noticed for being helpful!. You cant really say fuck off you are being an arse, as "what? i was just helping" ~ is the reply, but we all know what you are up to.

I was asked on an FLT course along time ago - "if you crash into a door, what do you do?". Everyone said, you ensure the area is safe, ensure you park the vehicle in a safe place, exit the vehicle in a safe manner, ensure the damage is reported... blah blah blah...  
The instructor said NO!!!. You will quickly look around to see if anyone has seen you. It is human nature. It is no different in tech.  

There are little mistake made each day that go unnoticed but every now and again a bigger one is made. So what do you do:  
What you should do and what you do are different. You WILL try to fix it quickly. What you should do is inform everyone as soon as you are aware.

My advise in life has always been tell the truth. People will respect you more, will trust you more and it is so much easier to live as you have not to remember the lies.   
What do you think your peers would prefer though
- OMG im F'ed up and I will need to fix it   
*OR*
- I did F up but I fixed it so we are good.  

I suspect the latter **BUT** that all depends on time and pressure.  
If the issue is seen, then questions will be asked so immediate declaration is best, if your peers don't like being spooked for no reason then a quick fix is best.

## So what should you do
I go with a small time frame. If you F Up bigtime, collect the issue, the possible solutions and if possible rectify but if you cant, declare **NOW**.  
I don't know whether that is the best solution but that is what id prefer if I was the one getting the news:  
- Ive made this issue
- It is due to this
- Ive tried this
- I believe this will fix the issue


## But wont that damage my rep?
Yes  
There you go. That is it.  


  Honestly, those that do not make mistakes are either Liars or Lazy (or have great PR)  
  If you are working hard and pushing the limits, things will happen, that is tech and testing and trying new things is the way we get better.  
  Its all about how you handle it. If you have made this mistake 3 times then maybe *you* should ask yourself a question or two because it can be assured your boss will BUT, if you have a logical reason why you took an approach, can indicate you did what you thought was right, and you stick around to fix the issue....  
  Well you are a good engineer and one id be happy to work beside. Dust yourself off, learn from that lesson.

## So who will (does) piss you off
  Now I will add that with 20/20 vision that is hindsight, some of those safety blankets you made, some of your decisions may not in the cold light of day hold up to scrutiny and fold like an origami frog BUT, you had them and you have learned a lesson on how not to do it and so have improved.

  So why the rant in the first paragraph.   
  Well there are plenty of people who enjoy others misfortune. They are scum but they are there. They are not helping but looking for there own glory.  
  Imagine, you have created a huge script, spent days perfecting it, adding output to indicate errors, monitored it, tweaking it and then it run on the live system.... **BOOM** It doesn't behave as expected but due to your hard work, the output identifies the issue, the safety blanket you put in place means that it can be remedied quickly but it will mean the issue does effect a number of people temporarily. So, here we go.  

  *Type 1*:  
  Hey ive seen this error!!!, and they are happy to back off while it is fixed, even extending the offer **privately** of help if needed.  
  These people are great, admittedly their mood may change and become a little less patient if the issue becomes a longer issue yet understand that if it does become large, it will become a large issue that will not be helped by them getting gnarly  

  *Type 2*:  
  Hey ive seen this error, and start to tell you how inconvenient it is to them and how safetys should have been in place and the roll back system should be more robust and that they will need to escalate this up the next couple of level....   
  Actually they are right and that will all be in the lessons learned and how we incrementally improve systems **BUT** - fuck off.  
  Its not the right time, what are they playing at.   
  Are they helping **NO**, are they trying to express how hard they are working and how important they are... again - *fuck off*.  

  *Type 3*:   
  Oh I see you have an issue, if youd of done x or y this wouldnt of happened, just offering this for the future.  
  Not now dickhead, you are not helping and sidetracking the fix but yeah  
  1: thanks  
  2: Yeah youve got your name out there as knowing lots, albeit on an issue that has occurred, as opposed to not yet occurred when we were working on it - which is where we came from.  

  *Type 4*:   
  If you need help im here!!!.. you reach out and they are nowhere to be seen.  
  Well done, you got your name in there... jerk

  *Type 5*:   
  Shit, id love to help but i have a family emergency.   
  Odd that these only occur when there is an issue!!! but you got your name in the list for people to see...

  *Type 6*:  
  Hey, @manager1, 2 and 3. the issue Geeky is having ive found the cause and here is the solution.  
  Thanks, but why not be a team player, offer the help to those fixing the issue as opposed to the managers.  
  Good managers knows instinctively that you are a no good arsehole but you may fall lucky and find a sucker.  
  You are an arse and the scourge of any industry, nobody likes you nor trusts you. You know those close colleagues you have? they are keeping their enemies closer, that is all.

  I can list lots more but **my advise to you** is, privately offer help, be patient. That's it, its not hard.

Advice and moan over :D
