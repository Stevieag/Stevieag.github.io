## Need a Google app?

I was looking for a Gmail app. It was astounding that there isnt one.  
You can use email apps but what if there was a simpler solution.

This is quick :P 


# Here we go

You are going to need to have chrome installed booooo!  
I know its not always the first choice but it is handy to have a second browser to check against.  
So:  
- Open chrome and go to your Google Mail (Gmail)
- In the menu bar find the three vertical dots (near your face in the top right)
- Click on the icon
- Go to 'More tools'
- Create Shortcut
- The window that pop up
    - Enter a name for your shortcut but ensure that you tick the box for 'Open as window' 
    - Click 'Create'

Locate the created Gmail icon, click and now you have a GMail app :D 
On the Mac you can set it to onpen up on log in and stay in the dock by right clicking and selected the options

There you go, quite a quick one.
