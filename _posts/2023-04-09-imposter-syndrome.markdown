# Imposter Syndrome - Really, I'm sick of hearing about it.

Yeah, everybody has jumped on this bandwagon. Everyone is Soooo vulnerable and precious.

Well, not everybody is. I've met a few characters in tech. My original exposure was to a lot of people who were helpful, genuine and a real team. This is me looking back to see the bigger picture.

As time has gone on, I've met some that really are just imposters. They plough through life by ignoring they're wrong, just bullying, not listening to others, and making the same mistakes again and again. This will make you very good at doing what you do and then, moving on before you are found out. That is not imposter syndrome, this is a very different thing.

In my original exposure to the tech scene, all people were unique, but understood that you can't know everything. For the first time, having people that I see as geniuses ask for my help was the time I shit myself. Well, this is one of the moments when I felt like an imposter.

# When did i see it for the first time?
I had never heard the term "imposter syndrome" until one day a friend at university said they felt I was a big sufferer.

What is the syndrome?

Try this link: [Very Well Mind - Imposter Syndrome](https://tinyurl.com/imposter-syndrome-exp) 
or 
Try this: [Mike Cannon-Brookes](https://tinyurl.com/Mike-Cannon-Brookes), an ultra successful guy, lets you in on how being clever or successful can knock you.

I'd worked and been successful before university. I was older than everyone in my cohort. This really adds pressure. I couldn't fail, it was so important that I didn't get it wrong. 

I was lucky that I met some very clever people. I felt out of my depth (as you should at university). I thought that these people were carrying me. They said, I was helping them and excelling in some areas. This was very hard for me to believe, surely I was lucky (lucky, fluked, liked <- all terms you use to dismiss that you're actually very good and/or learning a lot) and that part was an easy bit that I knew, or I had done something similar, there were so many reasons you can get in your head to dismiss success.

I got my job, I did well, and I still excel in this role. This isn't how I felt though. 
I have, after a number of years, learned to get a grip of this runaway self sabotage.

# But look at those people who are super confident.
Have you seen that person who tells everybody how good they are, they really believe it. At first, you may believe them, but then you see that they are not quite as good as they think!! This is the Dunning-Kruger effect. Put simply, you may have heard that term "a little knowledge can be dangerous". Well, here it is, they are blown away by their knowledge and think they are creating magic. Well, I won't knock that, as I too have been amazed by what can be done, BUT, this is where we diverge. I see how far I've come, but I also see how much I don't know.
The other person just doesn't see the upcoming learning curve. As a now experienced techie, I see these newbies come in, and I like that excitement and I would always encourage these people to keep learning. 
This is also where I explain my struggles with imposter syndrome. They are generally knocked sideways as they see me as a goal (I'm looking at what they are achieving and thinking wow too).

That is exactly what I want to explain. Nice, clever, genuine, honest people, know what they know, they also appreciate the effort and work that goes into learning and will always appreciate those around them. They know where they are going and where they have been. They are open and caring to those coming up behind them to join the tech team. That can also expose them to imposter syndrome as they are held up high.
Eventually they get comfortable knowing that the journey of learning will never end (just as you think, I've got this, you find something that slaps you around the chops and makes you humble again). They do get comfortable with what they know, as subject-matter expert and knowing that they can't know EVERYTHING, and getting happy with saying, I don't know. They are also happy to realise, as my ex-boss told me, that you ain't employed because you know it all, but because of your ability to, and that there is a lot more to you than just what you know.
Did you get the job because you are a genius or because you are nice? Probably both. If you knew nothing, you wouldn't be where you are, but if you know a lot and people can work with you, that's better than a genius who is arrogant, can't hold a conversation, etc.

Now, I am never going to tell you how to control your self-doubt, how it happens, or what to do for you, but I can share about me, and maybe that can help, but mostly, remember that you're not alone. Persons you speak to who are successful, clever, a person you feel knows it all. Honestly, unless it has gone to their head, and they have become an arrogant person (again, is that a manner to protect themselves from being found out (in their minds)), all those people have doubts. They may have worked through it and become comfortable with it, but, they all suffer.

# So
Well, my point is that imposter syndrome is nothing special; it doesn't make you different; it actually makes you just like everybody else. Do you breathe? Well, so does everybody else.
We now have a name for a natural thing, it is what drives you on, makes you humble, and makes you a nicer person.
None of this is to dismiss the feeling, it is real, just know, if there is someone you can share this with, do it. If there isnt, know that almost all are feeling the same. 

# Will you get over it
Maybe but most probaby, youll just get used to feeling this way.
Youll have times when you are on fire, feel youve learned loads then have days when you think, I have no idea what I'm doing.
On those low days, just look back, see all the amazing things you have done. Take a moment, have a short break and come back to your issue.

Ive just watched Lewis Capaldi on Netflix - even he suffers.

Look after yourself, work to live, balance is the key
