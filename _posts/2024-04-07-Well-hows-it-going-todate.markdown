My Training: Slow Progress, Steady Growth

Embarking into the world of cyber security is exciting and challenging. For someone like me its daunting and I see the level of knowledge I dont have (no dunning kruger here matey).

My pursuit of training has been met with a reality check â€“ progress is slow, but the baby steps I make are undeniably rewarding.
Firstly, I delved into platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe, enticed by promises of hands-on experience and real-world simulations. The allure of solving challenges and honing my skills was irresistible. Yet, as I immersed myself in these virtual environments, I quickly realised that its far from easy, as expected but even with walkthroughs its slow going.
Trying to understand the process and methods it really fun but its very slow and I have this inbuilt feeling that Im too slow and do feel time is running out to start the career but I need real world knowlwdge.

As said its fun and brings into use lots of bit from University that were covered in cyber sec modules. The programing donr in Uni is now needing to be pulled back from the rear of my mind to present. All very exciting and I feel each small step is one step nearer to mastery (still not confident). Some of the skills im picking up is making me look at things in a different manner. Like perusing website input boxes as a place for manipulation and a weak point.

TryHackMe has been great, it has presented me with lots of machines, each presenting unique obstacles to overcome. Concepts that seemed straightforward on paper have practice befiddles me. In exploiting vulnerabilities, I found myself grappling with networking protocols, cryptography, and other principles, building the conplexity as we go. Each step has needed patience and ultimately a walkthrough but I can feel the confidence building as I look at the attack surfaces and have some skills to at least start to look for issues before tapping out. 
THM, has offered a guided approach, with structured learning paths and interactive tutorials, yet some of the boxes have has me scratching my head for hours, But with each step and success is a huge level of satisfaction that adds to my determination to continue. 

Ive also reached out to some online groups and events to find some support. The cyber security genre is daughting and so far has pushed me away. I do feel there is a wish to be open but there alot of people that are chasing money over the passion that may be the issue.
In the events and communities, those at the leading edge speak with such passion and when you walk away from this to the general workforce there are many just giving the industry a bad rap. 
Joining local meetups and online forums exposed me to a wealth of knowledge and expertise but has also highlighted the width of the field and the daunting task of keeping pace with its rapid evolution. Conversations with seasoned professionals served as both inspiration and humbling reminders of how much I had yet to learn. When you do get to speak to the seasoned persons, they are welcoming, further down though, the dunning kruger really kicks in as lack of knowledge, shouting louder to appear clever and push away anyone that will find out is creeping in as in other areas of the tech industry.

Im slowly seeing each troubled step as a lesson, teaching me resilience and fortitude. I think im getting easier with the slow pace of my journey, recognising that deep knowledge cant be rushed. As I continue my training, I am reminded of a quote by Bruce Lee: "I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times." I hope its not about how quickly I progress, but rather the depth of understanding and expertise I cultivate along the way. '

So, to my fellow aspiring hackers facing similar struggles, I offer this advice: Embrace the journey, celebrate the victories, and learn from the defeats. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a master hacker. Slow progress is still progress, and with perseverance, we will reach our destination.

A person is not judged by how many times they are knocked down, but how many times they gets up to keep fighting on. OSCP seens a long way away but I will get there, I just might jump on the HTB Cert first.

Now i need two more docs to level up the three columns
