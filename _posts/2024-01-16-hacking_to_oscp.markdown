#Learning Hacking and Pursuing the OSCP Certification

So, another moron thinking they could be a HACKER. As someone passionate about digital security, I've decided to embark pursue a career and follow along on an exciting journey into the world of ethical hacking. 
My ultimate goal? Attaining the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. 
Im going to write up my notes and you could follow me on this adventure into cybersecurity, its challenges, and my pursuit of knowledge.

##Introduction

My intentions are purely ethical (Honest guvnor). 
I did cover cyber security at university and so this is the next step for me. I love digital forensics, started down the route of reverse engineering, played with some other areas but as with most uni modules, they are quick and high level. 
Its now time to break away from my present area of tech and follow what I really wish to be doing. The genre is wide, as wide as any area of tech. Id like to hit offensive/red team.

##Why Learn Hacking?

Learning hacking isn't just about gaining unauthorized access to systems; it's about understanding how they work and how to secure them. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber-attacks, ethical hackers play a pivotal role in safeguarding digital landscapes.
Id like to be part of that fight back, keep people safe and learn.

##Getting Started

To kickstart my journey, I'm diving into the basics of networking, operating systems, and programming languages. Understanding the foundations is key to becoming a proficient ethical hacker.
I have  signed up to Try Hack Me website. Its not cheap but i believe you do need to invest and back yourself at times. I have possibly made a mistake as all guidance seems to point at Hack the Box but you work with what you have. Security wasnt part of the company I work at when I started so changing direction is hard but I have made my intentions clear and have company backing to scratch my itch (as long as I keep doing my existing job).

##Learning Resources

    A couple books ive been advised to look at
    Books: "Hacking: The Art of Exploitation" by Jon Erickson and "Metasploit: The Penetration Tester's Guide" by David Kennedy.
    Online Platforms: Utilizing platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and OverTheWire for hands-on practice.

##Building Practical Skills

Theory is essential, but practical experience is where the real learning happens. I plan to immerse myself in real-world scenarios, honing my skills through simulated environments and challenges.
As said, TryHackMe is my go to as we speak. I have a life so have limited freetime (I work to live). I really wish to just enjoy work (as best you can).

##Preparing for OSCP

The Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) is a respected certification in the cybersecurity field. To prepare, I'll be dedicating time to THM and then the OSCP syllabus, engaging in labs, and working on vulnerable machines to develop the practical skills required for the exam.

##Challenges and Rewards

Undoubtedly, this journey will be challenging. Hurdles will emerge, and problem-solving skills will be put to the test. Yet, the satisfaction of overcoming challenges and contributing to a safer digital world makes it all worthwhile.

##Conclusion

As I document my progress, struggles, and victories, I will be smashing my note on the THM pathways here, I invite you to join me on this learning adventure. Whether you're a seasoned professional or a fellow enthusiast, your insights and support are invaluable. Together, let's explore the exciting and ever-evolving field of ethical hacking.

Stay tuned for updates, and let's hack responsibly! ðŸ’»ðŸ”’
