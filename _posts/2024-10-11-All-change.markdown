Well its been a while

Things have changed, and I hope for the better. I've taken a step in a different direction. Don't get me wrong, I still wish to pursue a career in security, but I had to accept that the offers were not going to just come to me without experience or another avenue.

For background, I have worked in a number of start-ups, and they are a different environment to work in. They are fickle, risky, challenging but offer close-knit teams and a sense of adventure you don't get elsewhere.
Joining early will give an opportunity to grow, but you have to be comfortable with change. You need to be happy to fill any space that is required. If you are a dev and that is all you do, then a start-up may not be the place for you. When the server breaks, if you aren't prepared to roll up your sleeves and get your hands dirty, you're not right for it. This can be the attractiveness of a start-up: not being a one-trick pony.

Well, I was in a start-up, but it had grown and was no longer a real start-up. I won't go deeply into it, but it had lost its way in many places. Successful? Yeah. It was almost making money and was on the path to greatness, but this was at the expense of the people. It may catch this and try to turn it around, but it had made many of the mistakes start-ups make and was way too top-heavy and no longer nimble. Push down mentality, and there was a lot of unhappiness and anger that after threats of leavings, union action and lots of letters, emails, meetings, surveys (oh the the constant surveys that are so skewed to get the answers they want, or stats that are skewed) they were trying to change, but in completely the wrong way. Just to cover the type of skew they used in an update. 
  - Latest "We have a happiness rating of 45%" : that is as good as the rest of the industry and so we are happy.
  - 1yr earlier "We have a happiness rating of 85%" : We are very proud with this and lead the industry. 
    
A trick employed (an old one) is to have Q1 just before this, to be:
  - Highlight a recent moment that has made you happy at work

then 
  - Q2: On a scale of 1 to 4, how would you describe your overall sense of happiness?
    - 1: Unhappy - I find it difficult to experience joy and satisfaction in my daily life.
    - 2: Happy - I generally feel positive and appreciate the good moments, even when faced with challenges.
    - 3: Slightly Happy - I often find reasons to smile and enjoy lifeâ€™s little pleasures, contributing to my overall well-being.
    - 4: Very Happy - I experience a deep sense of joy and fulfillment, embracing each day with enthusiasm and positivity.
  
  - Appraisal : You are scored from 4 : 1 = Below expectation 2 = Meeting or exceeding expectation 3 = Working well beyond expectation 4 = You lead the way. This was so skewed that only those with a 4 were considered for pay rises or promotion plus there was a cap on the numbers you could give, promotions and raises. 
    
    Everything was about being as good as others in the industry, there used to be a desire to be the best, lead the way and exceed. This change to be as good as the industy after so long leading was to many, failing and a degrade of the values and drive.

They made changes so did new stuff but then blamed the workforce for not joining in, people are sick of the place and people. Imagine telling your partner that they never take you out, and they then send YOU a ticket to the cinema, it's not the same. So when a company has lost its care for the people, to then offer opportunities to spend time with the execs, yet they are time-restricted and scheduled, it's not the same as hanging out together. Just a huge disconnect - the heart was gone. It needed a change of leadership and genuine honesty, care and regain trust.

So, as I say this in a past manner, I have left there. I was exceedingly loyal, gave chance after chance for the promises I was given to come to fruition, but all were, it appears, lies. There were too many career managers riding a gravy train. If you are unsure what I mean, these are people that manage for the money and are only interested in career progression, to get to the next level and pay increase. They are not interested in the company or the people. Generally, they have great CVs as they have worked for many companies in good positions. They always appear to have been ready for the next challenge. This all falls on its arse when they have to really do the job. When they meet a company where honesty was the foundation it's built on, they don't like being held to account. Some had been successful using a manner that was very different and counter to the company values, this was never challenged. There were bullies that were not held to account but had another layer placed under them, racists that were reported but never sacked just moved (promoted :O). This caused a huge swathe of leavers that all gave thier reasons for leaving but no action was taken to stem the flood of leavers. 

As I said, this isn't my first rodeo in a start-up, and this is a mistake start-ups make time and time again, until the IPO or takeover, and then it's a slow decline or just a corporate train ride/wreck.
So, it's no longer nimble, I can't trust anyone, there is no real career progression, so time to move. I want to work in security, and I don't have the experience, only a desire. I have a full-time role that is taking all my time up because I care about the company still. 

I have moved to another start-up: 
Why? Well, because it is at the phase of real care and growth. 
Is it security? Well, no and maybe. It is at the point where everyone has every job, so it does include security and could grow to a full-time role. 
Looking forward: if I take the role of security here, I will organically gain experience.

Now, wow, I'm so much happier. I have space to learn, experience and grow. 
This blog is going to have to change as I'm not concentrating on security. I'm at present concentrating on Kubernetes and tools around it; I'm now in the GCP world and AI.

I'll get back to security, and I hope to start enjoying the learning as opposed to feeling it is a bind I need to chase to get away from the hell hole I was in and be a career choice.
