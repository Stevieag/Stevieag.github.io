# The Perils of Startup Life: A Personal Perspective

My journey has led me through the thrilling yet treacherous landscape of startups aiming for the coveted Initial Public Offering (IPO). While the allure of going public may seem like the pinnacle of success, the reality often unveils a different storyâ€”a tale of trials and tribulations that can jeopardise the very core of a company and the human toll is devastating.

## The Initial Dream

In its infancy, a startup is a collective of passionate minds, driven by innovation and a shared vision to disrupt industries. Part of this dream is that you may witness the metamorphosis into a publicly-traded entity, reaping the collective rewards of tireless dedication. However, the path to an IPO is fraught with challenges, and the toll it takes on the individuals within the company is often overlooked.

## The Funding Conundrum

Startups, in their pursuit of IPO, frequently find themselves entangled in a complex web of venture capitalists, angel investors, and institutional funding. The relentless pressure to meet valuation targets and attract investors can result in compromises that not only undermine the very ethos of the startup but also lead to the loss of valued team members along the way.

## The Sacrifice of Innovation

As the focus shifts from innovation to meeting financial milestones, startups may inadvertently sacrifice the essence of what made them unique. The relentless pursuit of profit margins and shareholder value can stifle creativity, hindering the very innovation that propelled the company into the limelight.

## The Shattered Togetherness

Startups are celebrated for their dynamic and close-knit cultures. However, the quest for an IPO strains these bonds, transforming the once-familial atmosphere into a rigid corporate structure. The loss of togetherness is palpable, leaving employees feeling detached from the company's initial vision and each other.

Greed take over and the vultures sail in. The people that created this unicorn are pushed aside for those that have travelled this course, those with a laser focus on the IPO goal, they have no values, they are not part of the company, they are here to benefit themselves only. They will not be here after IPO as they have taken their chunk and left the shatter shell of this once great place. For those that stayed, endure the long hard road, to look at the remains and try to resusitate it.

I know from experience, it will never reach the loft hights. It will have the meat taken from the bones, ive been through this all before and remained to see the slow death. It may remain in name, it may shape shift but it will never be the peacock it once was.

I know of a few companies that have staedfast to their values, they remain great places to be and generally, stay private or get bought and then ruined (unless an equally great place merges (rare))

## The Human Cost of Meeting Expectations

The run to an IPO initiates a Sisyphean race against time. Startups grapple with the demands of scaling operations, ensuring profitability, and complying with regulations. The pressure to meet the expectations of shareholders and analysts can lead to rushed decisions, resulting in the loss of both talented individuals and the core values that defined the company.
There is the build up of teams and the busines, then the cash out and lay off to colour the books, lives wrecked as the values disappear as the greed takes over and the once trusted leaders turn their backs on the loyal teams. True colours show and it is ugly.

## Conclusion

I've witnessed firsthand the human toll of the pursuit of an IPO and the shattered remains that exist after. The initial dream of creating something extraordinary often gives way to the erosion of togetherness, the loss of valued team members, and the compromise of the very values that defined the company.
It's crucial for founders and stakeholders alike to navigate this journey with caution, ensuring that the very essence of the startup isn't lost amidst the chaos.

In the grand tapestry of startup life, the cost of an IPO should never be measured solely in financial terms. The true tragedy lies in the loss of the human connection, the disintegration of shared values, and the collective spirit that once defined the startup's identity.
